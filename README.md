# Teto-Voice-Changer
A Teto Voice Changer built off of the work of @wishtag, who is also known as Acrylic on other platforms.

This Voice Changer is designed to work on Windows operating systems, and support for other OS's is not planned. Sorry linux users.

A video tutorial for this program might be made eventually.

If you know what you're doing you can use the .py file to run the voice changer, else use the exe that will be made eventually.
